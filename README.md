Project overview

This project is done in January 2023. It is written in Java language, involving both front-end and back-end development.

Brief Description of the System
This system allows students to submit reservation requests to the university admin. Users can log into the system as student or admin as long as they enter the correct username and password. In this system, students have all the basic functions where they can add, edit, view and delete reservation requests under their own accounts; while for admins, they can manage all approved or pending requests done by the students. To put it short, its a system that checks all available and unavailable time slot for all the venues within the uni and make reservation process easier.
